# Wrap Up

We have installed packages necessary to create maps in R using _ggplot2_ and practice examples using vector data, our own point data and raster data.

We saw how to incorporate different types of data in one map and how to create maps of only the region of interest.


## Learning more

To learn more about how to make maps using _ggplot2_ and R, I recommend these articles. There are many others available, so have a look around and see what you can find!
