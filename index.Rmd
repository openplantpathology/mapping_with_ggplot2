# Introduction {-}

Creating maps with R often feels like a hard task, but it does not have to be.
With just a few packages it is possible to create high-quality maps for publication using _ggplot2_.

## What You Will Learn

Geographic information systems (GIS) is a field large enough to have whole degree programs dedicated to it and indeed, entire companies (_e.g._, [ESRI](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home)).
This short lesson will help you understand enough basic information to find and import data into R to create maps of your own research data.
It will not teach you all aspects of GIS or how to perform spatial analysis.
You will learn about the types of data that are used in making maps and how they differ and how you use them differently to create a map that clearly conveys the information you wish to deliver.

## What You Will Use

In this workshop we have already introduced the _tidyverse_, which _ggplot2_ is a part of.
We will use this to create our maps along with other packages for handling spatial data and importing data.
